# Cross-Court-Tennis-App
An app that will allow one to find competitive tennis matches and create a rankings list in the system. It will be built using PHP as the backend language and your standard HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end development. I plan to make this a facebook application.

The reason it is in Java right now is so that I can work out all of the logic involved. It may end up just being a Java project, I don't know yet. Feel free to contact me at bwmusiclover1212@gmail.com or drop by my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1530005253923849/
